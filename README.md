## Instructions to generate an SDG of a sample Java class.

- Install JDK/JRE 1.7, Eclipse Kepler, and the Soot Eclipse Plugin. The plugin itself is not maintained by the library authors so an older version is required.
- Right click on the test Java file -> Run Soot... -> Interactive Mode -> Set Main as the main class, and the java project as the project name -> ok
